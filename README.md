# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores Using Pandas 
Using Pandas data manipulation and summary statistics to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools and answering business questions.

Every year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students.

In this project, we will use standardized test performance data from NYC's public schools to identify the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, and find the city's top ten performing schools!
